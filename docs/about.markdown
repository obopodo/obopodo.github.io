For the past few years, I've been working as a Data Scientist, although my educational background and earlier experiences are rooted in biophysics and bioinformatics. However, music has always been my true passion, from playing piano to crafting experimental sounds.

Currently, I'm blending my technical, scientific, and musical skills to explore new creative possibilities and reflect on the world – and myself – through sound.

I particularly enjoy interactive projects because improvisation, randomness, and dialogue – whether with another person or an external object – genuinely capture the complexity and spontaneity of life.

As our world becomes increasingly digital and data-driven, I feel compelled to transform these intangible elements into something meaningful and beneficial. In my latest works, I'm interested in examining society, technology, and their interplay, broadly exploring political and social themes. As well as reflecting on cognition, consciousness, behaviour, and how these interact with modern technologies.

My technical skills include programming, data analysis, and machine learning. Musically, I primarily play synths, piano and guitar, along with some experience playing accordion, trumpet, and cello (though these three are less proficient).

I continuously expand my expertise in sound and other media technologies by working with tools such as MaxMSP, PureData, VCVRack, and TouchDesigner.
